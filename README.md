# CSharpCodingChallenge
A collection of C# coding challenges and solutions, including algorithmic problems, data structures, and practical programming exercises. This repository is designed for learning, practicing, and sharing C# code, with clear documentation and test cases for each challenge.

## Feature
- The OldPhonePad Kept in the CSharpCodingChallenge>Source
- Decodes an old-style phone pad sequence into a string.
  - The sequence stops at the first '#' character.
  - '*' clears the current sequence.
  - ' ' (space) finalizes the current character and resets the count.
- TestProject will log the test result in TRX file => can be opened by TRX viewer 

## Tech Stacj 
### CharpCodingChallenge
